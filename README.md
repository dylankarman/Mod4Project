Making a recommendation system
A recommender system or a recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the rating or preference a user would give to an item.
This is very useful for companies such as Netflix and Amazon, where a proper recommendation can boost revenue significantly.
In this repo we have a movie recommendation system that references user ratings against your own to tell you what you should watch next!
For this particular project the SVDpp algorithm worked the best and was what I used. 
Please feel free to scroll to the bottom, rate 50 movies that you have seen, and let the program take over from there. 
Have fun!
